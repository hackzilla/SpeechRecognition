# Speech Recognition by OfDan

## Overview
"Speech Recognition by OfDan" is a SwiftUI-based application for iOS, designed to demonstrate the capabilities of speech recognition and text-to-speech synthesis in Swift. The app listens to spoken English and displays the transcribed text on the screen. Users have the option to copy the text and to have the app speak the transcribed text out loud.

## Features
- **Speech Recognition**: The app actively listens to spoken English and transcribes it after a short delay.
- **Text Display**: Transcribed text is displayed on the screen for easy reading.
- **Copy Functionality**: Users can copy the transcribed text for use in other applications.
- **Speech Output**: There is an option to have the app read the transcribed text aloud, showcasing text-to-speech capabilities.
